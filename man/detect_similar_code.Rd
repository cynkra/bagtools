\description{
This is a wrapper around \code{dupree::dupree()}. It analyses provided files looking for
similar code. It is a bit slow so it can be impractical on big projects to run
it with default (all files contained in working directory recursively), in
this case it is wiser to run it on one or more specific \code{paths} or/and
or to filter the files using the \code{pattern} argument.
